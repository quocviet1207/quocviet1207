<h1> 👋 About Me:</h1>
Hiii! Welcome to my GitHub landing page!<br /> <br />
My name is Viet, a rising junior in Computer Engineering with a minor in Robotics at the University at Buffalo.<br /> <br />
I was a CS student at first, but I want to have more hands-on experience; that's why I switched to CE. And working with hardware is great so far for me. <br /> <br />
However, as you know that doing a hardware project is so much harder than software, which you need to buy different electronic components, limited resources, etc. But yeh, I hope that I can figure out what I'm really interested in hardware. <br /> <br />
For software, tbh I'm not that into website development, but I love working on projects with AI/ML, such as computer vision. Besides that, in Robotics, I am currently interested in working on the perception of Robotics, such as SLAM. <br /><br />

🔭 I’m currently trying to **build something cool in Robotics and AI/ML** <br />

🌱 I’m currently learning **Pytorch, AI/ML, Robotics** <br />

🤝 I’m looking for help with **how to be a Robotic Engineering in the future 🤖** <br />

📫 You can reach out to me at: **phamlequocviet1207@gmail.com** <br />

⚡ Fun fact **I had tried to eat python 🐍 and stork🪿** <br />
